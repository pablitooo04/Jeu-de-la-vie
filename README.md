#Game of Life
Game of Life with Tkinter

Recreates the rules of John Horton Conway’s Game of Life.

#How it works
To advance generations one by one, use left‑click.
To enable Autorun mode, press the space bar.
The window dimensions can be modified as long as the aspect ratio remains 1:1.
The matrix dimensions can also be modified, provided the ratio stays 1:1.

#Implementation
The implementation of this Game of Life is very simple and minimalistic.
All matrix operations use Python’s built‑in features and require no third‑party modules.
Only Tkinter is needed to display the grid.

#EDIT Mode
To activate EDIT mode, use right‑click.
EDIT mode allows you to modify the matrix in real time by manually adding cells.
EDIT mode can only be enabled if Autorun mode is not active.
To exit EDIT mode, use right‑click again.
